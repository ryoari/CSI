# Docs

This directory contains current, accepted documentation underpinning CSI.
These documents cover all aspects of CSI ranging from the project down to
detailed designs for specific feature implementations.

If you're trying to learn more about CSI, we recommend starting at
[`/README.md`](/README.md).

## Design

CSI's design and rationale are documented in the
[`design/` directory](design/README.md). This documentation is intended to
support the following audiences:

-   People who wish to determine whether CSI would be the right choice for a
    project compared to other existing plagarism detection tools.
-   People working on the evolution of the CSI who wish to
    understand the rationale and motivation for existing design decisions.
-   People working on a specification or implementation of CSI
    who need a detailed understanding of the intended design.

This is in contrast to [proposals](/proposals/README.md), which document the
individual decisions that led to this design (along with other changes to the
CSI project), including the rationale and alternatives considered.

## Project

The [`project/` directory](project/README.md) contains **to-be-written** project-related
documentation for CSI, including:

-   [goals](project/goals.md), and the
    [principles](project/principles/README.md) and [roadmap](project/roadmap.md)
    derived from those goals,
-   how the project works, and
-   how to contribute.

## Guides

The [`guides/` directory](guides/README.md) contains **to-be-written** end-user
documentation for anyone trying to use CSI.
